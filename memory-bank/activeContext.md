# Active Context: Document Brand Detection System

## Current Work Focus
✅ **500 ERROR ISSUE RESOLVED**: Fixed critical 500 Internal Server Errors that occurred during brand detection processing! Implemented retry logic, exponential backoff, and improved error handling in Firebase operations to prevent resource contention issues.

✅ **IMPROVEMENT COMPLETED**: Enhanced image resolution and text-based brand detection for architectural plans! The system now processes images at higher resolution (600 DPI) and uses optimized prompts specifically for detecting brands mentioned as text in architectural drawings.

✅ **LIMITS REMOVED**: Eliminated all file size limits and timeouts to support heavy PDF processing! The system now handles large architectural plans without restrictions.
