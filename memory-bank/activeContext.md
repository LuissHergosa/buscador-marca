# Active Context: Document Brand Detection System

## Current Work Focus
Frontend development completed! The entire system is now ready for integration testing and deployment. Both backend and frontend are fully functional with modern UI/UX, real-time updates, and complete document management capabilities.

## Immediate Next Steps

### Phase 1: Backend Development ✅ COMPLETED
1. **Set up FastAPI project structure** ✅
   - Initialize project with UV package manager
   - Configure dependencies and project structure
   - Set up basic FastAPI application

2. **Implement core services** ✅
   - PDF processing service (extract pages, convert to images)
   - Brand detection service (Langchain + Gemini 2.5)
   - Firebase integration service
   - Processing orchestration service

3. **Create API endpoints** ✅
   - Document upload endpoint
   - Document management endpoints
   - Progress tracking endpoints
   - Results retrieval endpoints

### Phase 2: Frontend Development ✅ COMPLETED
1. **Set up React project with Bun** ✅
   - Initialize React project with Vite
   - Configure shadcn/ui with modern-minimal theme
   - Set up Tailwind CSS and project structure

2. **Implement core components** ✅
   - Document upload component (drag & drop)
   - Document list and management
   - Results display and filtering
   - Real-time progress indicators

3. **Enhance UI/UX** ✅
   - Improve upon the base design from test.tsx
   - Implement modern, responsive design
   - Add real-time updates and animations

### Phase 3: Integration & Testing
1. **Docker setup**
   - Create Dockerfiles for both services
   - Configure docker-compose.yml
   - Set up development environment

2. **Firebase configuration**
   - Set up Firebase project connection
   - Configure Firestore collections
   - Implement data models and storage

3. **End-to-end testing**
   - Test complete workflow
   - Validate real-time updates
   - Performance testing

## Current Decisions & Considerations

### Technical Decisions Made
- **Backend**: FastAPI with UV package manager for modern Python development
- **Frontend**: React with Bun and shadcn/ui for modern UI development
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore for flexible document storage
- **AI**: Google Gemini 2.5 via Langchain for brand detection
- **Real-time**: WebSocket or Server-Sent Events for live updates
- **Containerization**: Docker Compose for easy development and deployment

### Architecture Decisions
- **Async Processing**: Each PDF page processed independently
- **No PDF Storage**: Only analysis results stored, not original files
- **Simple Brand Detection**: LLM text response only, no bounding boxes
- **Real-time Updates**: Live progress tracking during processing

### UI/UX Improvements from test.tsx
- **Modern Design**: Replace dark theme with modern-minimal theme
- **Better Layout**: Improved responsive grid and card layouts
- **Enhanced Upload**: Drag-and-drop interface with progress indicators
- **Real-time Feedback**: Live progress updates during processing
- **Better Navigation**: Improved document management and filtering

## Active Considerations

### Performance
- PDF processing efficiency for large documents
- Image optimization before AI processing
- Real-time update frequency and bandwidth usage
- Firebase query optimization

### User Experience
- Intuitive file upload process
- Clear progress indicators during processing
- Easy-to-understand results display
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

### Scalability
- Handling multiple concurrent document uploads
- Efficient async processing of multiple pages
- Database performance with large result sets
- Future authentication and multi-user support

## Known Issues & Challenges
- **API Rate Limits**: Google Gemini API usage limits
- **File Size Limits**: Large PDF handling and processing
- **Real-time Complexity**: WebSocket connection management
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation for failed pages

## Success Criteria for Current Phase
- [ ] Backend can process PDF files and extract pages
- [ ] Brand detection works with Gemini 2.5
- [ ] Firebase integration stores and retrieves data
- [ ] Frontend provides intuitive document upload
- [ ] Real-time updates work during processing
- [ ] Complete workflow functions end-to-end
- [ ] Docker setup works for local development

## Next Milestone
Complete Phase 3 (Integration & Testing) with end-to-end testing and deployment preparation.
