# Active Context: Document Brand Detection System

## Current Work Focus
✅ **OCR + LLM INTEGRATION COMPLETED**: Successfully implemented EasyOCR + LLM pipeline for brand detection! The system now uses EasyOCR to extract text from image chunks with coordinate preservation, then analyzes the complete extracted text with Gemini LLM for brand detection.

✅ **500 ERROR ISSUE RESOLVED**: Fixed critical 500 Internal Server Errors that occurred during brand detection processing! Implemented retry logic, exponential backoff, and improved error handling in Firebase operations to prevent resource contention issues.

✅ **IMPROVEMENT COMPLETED**: Enhanced image resolution and text-based brand detection for architectural plans! The system now processes images at higher resolution (600 DPI) and uses optimized prompts specifically for detecting brands mentioned as text in architectural drawings.

✅ **LIMITS REMOVED**: Eliminated all file size limits and timeouts to support heavy PDF processing! The system now handles large architectural plans without restrictions.

✅ **PIL LIMITS REMOVED**: Eliminated PIL decompression bomb limits and added comprehensive logging for debugging! The system now processes images of any size without restrictions.

✅ **HOT RELOADING IMPLEMENTED**: Added complete development environment with hot reloading for frontend! The system now supports automatic code refresh during development for faster iteration.
