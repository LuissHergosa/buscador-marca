## Current Blockers
- None identified yet

## Next Immediate Actions
1. **Set up Backend Project Structure**
   - Initialize FastAPI project with UV
   - Configure dependencies and basic structure
   - Set up basic FastAPI application

2. **Configure Firebase Connection**
   - Set up Firebase project access
   - Configure Firestore collections
   - Test database connectivity

3. **Create Basic API Endpoints**
   - Document upload endpoint
   - Basic CRUD operations
   - Health check endpoint

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Backend can start and respond to requests
- [ ] PDF upload and processing works
- [ ] Brand detection returns expected results
